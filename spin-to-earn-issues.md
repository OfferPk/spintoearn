# Spin-to-Earn Wheel Functionality Issues

After analyzing the Flappy Bird game code with spin-to-earn functionality, I've identified the following issues that need to be addressed:

## Core Functionality Issues

1. **No Persistence of Player Balance**
   - Player balances are stored in a JavaScript variable (`playerBalance`) but not saved to local storage
   - Balances reset when the page is refreshed
   - No mechanism to track historical spins or rewards

2. **Missing Spin Cooldown System**
   - No cooldown period between spins
   - Players can continuously spin the wheel without limitations
   - No daily spin limits implemented

3. **Lack of Anti-Cheat Measures**
   - No validation to prevent manipulation of spin results
   - Client-side probability determination is vulnerable to tampering
   - No server-side verification of spin results

4. **No Integration with Main Game**
   - Spin rewards don't affect the main game experience
   - No way to use earned currency in the game
   - Missing score update mechanism after spin

## UI and User Experience Issues

1. **Limited User Identification**
   - No login/signup system to identify users
   - No way to associate spins with specific users
   - Missing country flag and email integration

2. **Incomplete Reward Feedback**
   - Basic celebration effects but no persistent notification system
   - No history display of past spins and rewards
   - Missing visual feedback for cooldowns or limits

3. **Mobile Experience Limitations**
   - No screen rotation capability for vertical gameplay
   - Limited touch controls optimization
   - No PWA support for offline capabilities

## Missing Advanced Features

1. **No Leaderboard System**
   - Missing competitive element to compare rewards with other players
   - No privacy controls for leaderboard participation

2. **No Progressive Jackpot**
   - All rewards are fixed values
   - No accumulating jackpot that grows over time

3. **Missing Monetization Integration**
   - No in-app purchase options
   - No referral system to grow user base
   - No ad integration options

## Technical Implementation Issues

1. **Limited Error Handling**
   - No graceful error recovery if wheel animation fails
   - Missing fallback mechanisms for mobile vibration API

2. **Incomplete Mobile Support**
   - Basic responsive design but not fully optimized
   - Missing touch-specific interactions for spin wheel

These issues will be addressed systematically in the enhancement process, starting with fixing the core spin-to-earn wheel functionality.
